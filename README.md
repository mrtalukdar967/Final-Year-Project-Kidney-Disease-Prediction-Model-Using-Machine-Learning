# Final-Year-Project-Kidney-Disease-Prediction-Model-Using-Machine-Learning

**Objective of the Project**
The primary objective of creating the kidney disease prediction model is to develop a robust and accurate tool for early detection and risk assessment of kidney diseases. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model aims to analyze diverse medical parameters and provide timely predictions, enabling proactive healthcare interventions. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance preventive care strategies and contribute to better patient outcomes by identifying potential kidney-related risks in advance.
